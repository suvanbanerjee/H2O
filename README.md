# H2O

This branch is for people who wants just a simple water drinking reminder. Nothing fancy here, just a simple reminder to drink water every hour.

## How to use

1. Clone the repository 
2. Switch to the `simple` branch by running `git checkout simple`
3. install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. add this main.pyw to your startup folder (If you don't know how to do that, just google it)

## Note
open the `main.pyw` file and change the `time_interval` variable to the number of minutes you want to be reminded to drink water. The default is 60 minutes. 

### Do check the `main` branch for a better version of this project.
